This is my Rails project, where Iâ€™ve created a simple blog system and learned the basics of Ruby on Rails including:

* Models, Views, and Controllers (MVC)
* Data Structures & Relationships
* Routing
* Migrations
* Views with forms, partials, and helpers
* RESTful design
* Adding gems for extra features
